I want to implement the CUDA version of my Trapezoidal Rule project. Can you guide me on how to set up the CUDA environment and how I should approach writing the kernel

Can you help me understand how to parallelize the trapezoidal rule using CUDA? I need to know how the threads should handle their portions of the interval and how the final result should be combined.

Since I can't run CUDA on my Mac, can you explain how to compile and run my .cu file in Google Colab using a GPU runtime?

I need to measure CUDA execution time correctly for my report. What is the right way to time the kernel using CUDA events?

Can you help me summarise the CUDA implementation, the kernel strategy, and the performance observations in a concise report-ready format

For the performance section, what thread/block configurations should I test, and how should I record the results to compare them properly?
