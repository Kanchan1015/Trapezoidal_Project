ok im starting the openmp part, i already wrote some serial code, can u just explain how to parallelise the sum part using reduction? keep it simple.

im confused with how to pass thread count from argv in c, can u show me a tiny example?

i tried writing the loop with #pragma omp parallel for but i think im messing the reduction. can u tell me the right way?

what timer should i use for openmp version? is clock_gettime fine? i want a clean format for printing time.

i wrote some code but not sure if my header comment is correct for the assignment. can u tell me what i should include?

compiling with gcc -fopenmp gives me an error on my mac, do i need a different gcc version?

ok explain to me how to test this with different threads. like 1,2,4,8… just tell me the commands i should use.

can u show me how to append the output to a csv in a neat way? something small, i can edit later.

i need a small readme for the openmp folder. just basics, nothing big.

write me a short explanation for my report about how the omp part works. keep it simple, 2–3 paras.
