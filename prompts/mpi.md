hey im starting the mpi part… how do i split the n values across ranks ? can u teach me its consfusing

bthis remainder thing when n not divisible… can u jus show me the logic

my rank 0 printing but other ranks also printing sometimes . how to restrict properly?

timer for mpi… where exactly should i start it? after mpi init ?

mpi_reduce syntax i always confuse can u check this line if it's right?

local_a and local_b calculation looks messed can u tell me if i did the logic right?

i think my local_n becoming zero for some ranks machan… is that possible? how to handle that?

when i run with 4 processes my result slightly diff from single process… is tht normal or i messed smth?

mpirun -np 4 ./a.out 10000000 works but -np 8 shows slower time… normal ah on laptop?

can u tell me if im placing mpi_barrier in the right place? i want only compute time

hey my code compiles but shows segmentation fault when >4 processes… what should i check first?

i printed offset and local_n and it looks weird. how to verify if distribution is correct?

result shows 2.0000000004 something. thats okay no? sin integration supposed to be 2 right?
